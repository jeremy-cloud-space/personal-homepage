# About
GitHub repository for my personal website, which will also be used to learn GitHub actions for CI/CD
Frameworks used includes:

1. React (FrontEnd)
2. Bootstrap (Styling)

Github will be used for deployment and hosting of the webpage. Some things that I will like to have in the end product includes:

1. Biography: Professional and personal interests
2. Ongoing learning projects

Eventually, the website will be used to link out to various web applications that I intend to build in my own cloud learning journey.
